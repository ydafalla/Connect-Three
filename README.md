# Connect-Three
The goal of the project is to implement the Connect Three Game. Connect 3 is a game like connect 4 with some variations. Connect-4 is a classic board game that is played by two players. It is a game that uses checker pieces on a vertical grid to arrange a tic-tac-toe type of victory by matching four pieces  in a row. The differences between this game and connect 4 is that this game uses a point based system to add points by matching 3 pieces in tic-tac-toe type of matching. The game also makes use of some items with different functionalities that can be bought from an items store and will cost the player some points. The game uses a flexible grid  instead of the 6x7 grid that is used in the connect 4, and allows the players to decide the size of grid they want to play at.
